## 03 - ```SQL ESSENTIAL - PHASE 1 - CREATE DATABASE```

[SQL ESSENTIAL - PART 1 - CREATE DATABASE](phase1/)

* The goal is to create a company database with multiple interrelated tables.

* Each group is responsible for creating specific tables and populating them with data.

* Once all data is in place, groups will then establish relationships and constraints using ALTER and UPDATE statements.

## Project Overview & Scope

### Goal:

- The primary objective is to create a company database.
- This database will consist of multiple interrelated tables.

### Group Responsibilities:

- Each group has specific responsibilities:
    - Creating and defining tables.
    - Populating these tables with relevant data.

### Establishing Relationships and Constraints:

- After data population, groups will set up relationships and constraints.
- Use SQL statements like ALTER and UPDATE to enforce data integrity.

### Data Insertion and Query Tasks:

- Import data from another database (which generates data).
- Perform query tasks to test and manipulate the data.

### Views and Stored Procedures:

- Create views for different purposes (e.g., reporting, analytics).
- Store procedures to execute multiple steps as a single package.


## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and design of SQL databases.
- Learn to create and manipulate tables using T-SQL.
- Develop skills in ensuring data integrity through constraints.
- Practice writing complex SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data.


## Requirements

- `Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio`: V 20.2 or Higher
- `Azure Data Studio`: V 1.49 or Higher
